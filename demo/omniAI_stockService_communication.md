# OmniAI and Stock Service Communication

OmniAI when prompted with a text that contains the **keyword "latest"** and a **ticker symbol** **among "TSLA", "AAPL", "GOOGL", "AMZN", "MSFT", and "NFLX"** will fetch the last 30-day stock data and their corresponding technical indicators from Stock Service data provider. This bidirectional communication between machines requires valid VC JWT for both parties to be successful.
